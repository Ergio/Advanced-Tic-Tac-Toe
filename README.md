## Description
<b>Tic Tac Toe</b> – 5 In Row is a fun board game. It is an extension of the classic tic tac toe game we all played as kids – only this version is for adults. Instead of playing using 3 “X”s and “O”s (stones) on a 3x3 square board - Tic Tac Toe – 5 In Row offers you an unlimited number of stones on a board of 16x16 squares and you need to get 5 stones in row to win.
